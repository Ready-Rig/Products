Overview:

Introducing VEGA — Taking the success of the Ready Rig GS with ProArms to a new level.  
 
Upgrading to VEGA offers the highest level of performance and precision with an enhanced lift system that provides more stability and an even, balanced boom action, while absorbing unwanted bounce motion. This ergonomic design enables you to extend your shooting time and lessens fatigue by redistributing the weight load to your legs and core. The VEGA vest also features a backside handgrip tailored for a spotter to guide you through even the trickiest shots.
 
The VEGA bolts onto the back of the Ready Rig, replacing the GS bungee cords with a new elastic counterbalance system. VEGA’s innovative bands attach to the ProArms enabling smoother action and weight support, that can essentially float your camera package at all ranges.
 
VEGA is the changing the game for serious cinematographers, dissolving limitations with smoother camera control and more support throughout the entire boom range — providing the freedom of movement that enables you to create without limitations.
