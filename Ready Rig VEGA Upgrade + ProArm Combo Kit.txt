Overview:

Go beyond the next level with the VEGA + ProArms Upgrade Combo.
 
Upgrading to VEGA offers the highest level of performance and precision with an enhanced lift system that provides more stability and an even, balanced boom action, while absorbing unwanted bounce motion. Our ergonomic design enables you to extend your shooting time and lessens fatigue by redistributing the weight load to your legs and core. VEGA bolts onto the back of the Ready Rig, replacing the GS bungee cords with a new elastic counterbalance system.
 
The ProArms feature telescopic carbon fiber support arms that increase the payload from 30 to 40 pounds. They telescope from 24 to 37”, generating an effective boom range of 55” that can be operated in a locked or unlocked position, allowing for sweeping movements and vertical axis stabilization. Additionally, the ProArms feature 1/4"-20 and 3/8"-16 threads that allow you to mount monitors to either arm to keep it in your line of sight. 
 
Overall, the VEGA + ProArm Combo is changing the game for serious cinematographers, dissolving limitations with smoother camera control and more support throughout the entire boom range — providing the freedom of movement that enables you to create without limitations.
